# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

## Definition

The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively as follows:

- Fib(0) = 0
- Fib(1) = 1
- Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2) for n > 1

In other words, each term (except the first two) is the sum of the two previous terms.

## Example Sequence

Here is an example Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

Each number in the sequence is obtained by adding the previous two numbers.

## Properties

- The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio, approximately 1.6180339887.
- The Fibonacci sequence exhibits various interesting mathematical properties and appears in many different areas of science, nature, and art.

## Applications

The Fibonacci sequence has numerous applications in various fields, including:

- Mathematics: Number theory, combinatorics, and discrete mathematics.
- Computer Science: Algorithm optimization, dynamic programming, and generating pseudo-random numbers.
- Finance: Modeling financial markets, calculating interest rates, and analyzing stock price movements.
- Nature and Biology: Modeling population growth, analyzing plant structures, and describing animal breeding patterns.
- Art and Design: Creating visually appealing compositions, generating aesthetically pleasing shapes, and designing computer-generated graphics.
