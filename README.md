## Fibonacci
This exercise is based on the Fibonacci sequence as defined here: [Fibonacci Sequence Definition](fibonacci-sequence.md)

The code is intended to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given length. Unfortunately, there are several errors 
that need to be found and fixed. 

Please analyse the code by any means, preferably debugging, and fix the errors to get the code running and doing 
what it has been implemented for. 

## Collection
This exercise reflects a notebook with some physician names in it. You can write more names in to it, read them out 
or cross them out again. 

Unfortunately, the code includes some errors that block the notebook to work properly. Initially, there are four names 
written in, and they are read out. Then, one name is crossed out and read out again, but the name is still in there.

Please analyse the code by any means, preferably debugging, and fix the errors to get the code running and doing
what it has been implemented for.
